Leanne Khashab's Website

Hello,
In this repository you can find the html project I worked on to create a website. This website gives a little more detail about my life and, although it needs more work, it is a fun way of practicing working with html programming and creating css files. The index page includes a small intro to who I am and a fun fact about me. I included a portfolio page to talk about some of the projects I have worked on and want to work on in the future. As well a qualifications page showcasing my resume. The last page includes service projects I have worked on. Throughout the site I have included links to projects and or organizations I have been apart of. 

This is the link to find the live version of my website:
