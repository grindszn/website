   <h6> <p style="color: #D7A9E3FF">Howdy, My name is Leanne Khashab.<br>
       I am currently a Junior Computer Science major from
        <br>Dallas, Tx and have created this website for you to get to know 
        <br>me a litte more! A fun fact about me outside from my  
        <br>programming projects, is that I love being outdoors.
         If you couldn't
        <br> tell from my picture I love going on hikes when 
        I travel or any outdoor activities.
        I love to travel whenever I get the chance and have 
        already visited over 25 countries around the world.
         At A&M I am part of an organization known as FREE which 
         involves helping mentor freshmen engineers as they make the
          transition from high school to college. We also help build 
          their professional skills. I worked alongside my partner last 
          year to bring company speakers from NASA and Exxonmobile to 
          present to the freshmen, and arranged resume building workshops. 
      Last spring I joined the Engineering podcasting team. 
      This <br>university level  podcast known as SoundBytes allows 
      our<br> team to interview students and faculty over critical <br>
      social issues. Feel free to click through the other <br>tabs on 
      my webpage at the bottom are <br>links to my organization and podcast .
